    "The housing market is a dynamic and complex system influenced by various factors such as economic conditions, demographic changes, and local developments. In recent years, machine learning (ML) techniques have gained prominence in predicting house prices, offering more accurate insights and aiding stakeholders in making informed decisions. This project focuses on predicting house prices in Melbourne using advanced ML models. As individuals and investors navigate this dynamic market, the ability to make informed decisions regarding property transactions becomes increasingly crucial. Traditional methods of estimating property values often fall short in capturing the intricate patterns and nuances present in the Melbourne housing market. This project seeks to bridge this gap by harnessing the power of machine learning to predict house prices with a higher degree of accuracy."
